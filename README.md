Hello!  It's such a pleasure to be on this learning journey with everyone!

I am a veteran middle school math and science teacher of ten years, and started teaching beginning coding to my students as an elective.  With the help of resources like Code.org, CodeCombat, and others, I have been able to spark an interest in my students.  But I also realized that I really had no idea what I was teaching or where it led.  So, I decided to start learning more about web development and other types of programming.  I started with Khan Academy and Codeacademy, but felt so very limited in the things I gained from those places.  I've completed 78 modules in FreeCodeCamp as of this writing, and I already feel more confident in my coding.

So, I am seriously considering making a career change, here.  I love teaching, but I also love creating and technology.  We'll see where this takes me.  So far, it's just a whole lot of FUN!

Cheers!

Kris
